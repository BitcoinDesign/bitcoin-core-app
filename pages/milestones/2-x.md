# Milestones 2.x

Once parity with the existing QT-based application was reached (as is the goal with the 1.x milestones), there will still be improvements to be made and features to be added. This includes some very obvious additions, as well as some more conceptual ones that require more exploration.

- [Snapshot]({{ '/snapshot/' | relative_url }})
- [Explorer]({{ '/explorer/' | relative_url }})
- [Conole]({{ '/console/' | relative_url }})
- [Showcase]({{ '/showcase/' | relative_url }})
- [Contacts]({{ '/contacts/' | relative_url }})
- [Addresses]({{ '/addresses/' | relative_url }})
- [Silent payments]({{ '/silent-payments/' | relative_url }})
- [Test transactions]({{ '/test-transactions/' | relative_url }})

Priorization, milestone numbers, etc are all to-be-determined.
