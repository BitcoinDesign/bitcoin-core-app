# Multiple recipients

**Status: Early design exploration**

Batch transactions can be enabled via the menu. The user can add more recipients and specify amounts for each.

{% include picture.html
	image = "/assets/images/send/batch-transactions.png"
	retina = "/assets/images/send/batch-transactions@2x.png"
	big = "/assets/images/send/batch-transactions-big.png"
	alt-text = "Send screen with a pagination for batch transactions"
	width = 800
	height = 551
%}

The review screen lists all transactions in a simple list and shows the total amount to be sent.

	big = "/assets/images/send/batch-review-big.png"
	alt-text = "Review screen with a summary of all transactions"
