# First use

The first time a user tries an application is an essential experience that can make them appreciate the features and happily return for repeat use, or it can turn them away forever. The reality is usually somewhere in between and depends on the user and their context. But, with a well-considered first-use experience, we can help them get a good start.

The cover screen also offers access to the [about]({{ '/settings/about' | relative_url }}) screen and [developer options]({{ '/settings/developer' | relative_url }}).

{% include picture.html
	image = "/assets/images/first-use/cover.png"
	retina = "/assets/images/first-use/cover@2x.png"
	big = "/assets/images/first-use/cover-big.png"
	alt-text = "Cover, about and developer option screens"
	width = 800
	height = 551
%}

Ideally, users already clearly understand the application benefits and unique features. The website from which it is downloaded should already have communicated these. However, it can still be beneficial to repeat them. This clears up false expectations and prepares users for what they are about to do next. 

{% include picture.html
	image = "/assets/images/first-use/info.png"
	retina = "/assets/images/first-use/info@2x.png"
	big = "/assets/images/first-use/info-big.png"
	alt-text = "Info screens to explain the app purpose and essential features"
	width = 800
	height = 417
%}

Since the application requires a lot of storage, we may want to offer users some simple options, particularly on smart phones. Ideally, the application detects available drives and space, and makes an appropriate recommendation that the user only needs to confirm.

First, the user chooses between pruning and storing all downloaded blocks. They also have the option to customize the maximum amount of storage to use. Also see [storage settings]({{ '/settings/storage/' | relative_url }}).

{% include picture.html
	image = "/assets/images/first-use/storage-amount.png"
	retina = "/assets/images/first-use/storage-amount@2x.png"
	big = "/assets/images/first-use/storage-amount-big.png"
	alt-text = "Screens for choosing between pruned or full block data storage"
	width = 800
	height = 417
%}

Then the user decides where to keep downloaded data. They can easily choose desired storage location if the default one is not preferred or has not enough space available. 

{% include picture.html
	image = "/assets/images/first-use/storage-location.png"
	retina = "/assets/images/first-use/storage-location@2x.png"
	big = "/assets/images/first-use/storage-location-big.png"
	alt-text = "Screen for choosing default or custom storage location"
	width = 800
	height = 417
%}
